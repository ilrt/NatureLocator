				<h1>Help on validating leaf damage</h1>

				<p>When rating images for damage you are only scoring for leaf
					mines. Horse chestnut tree leaves may also be damaged by fungal
					attack or stress and many of the images in our study will contain
					evidence of these. Use the table and images below to help you
					become familiar with the differences.</p>

								and rarely crosses the mid-vein of the leaf.</td>

								veins. Each patch of damage is a spreading single blotch, which
								may be much larger than a leaf mine.</td>

								be very small to covering the whole of the leaf edge.</td>

						<tr>
							<td>Leaf mines usually start away from the edge of the leaf

							<td>Usually extends from the edge of the leaf towards the
								centre.</td>
							<td>Position varies. Damage due to vessels in the tree that
								carry sap normally produces browning along the edge of the leaf.
								Damage due to exposure or abrasion can produce brown patches
								that may or may not cross leaf veins.</td>

				<div class="example-image even">
					<img src="images/typical-example3.png">
					<dl>
						<dt>Damage rating 3</dt>
						<dd>All the damage here is leaf mines, but it is hard to say
							whether there is more leaf mines or green leaf. Notice that some
							of the older leaf mines have been attacked by the fungus (so have
							a yellow edge), but they are clearly the same shape as other leaf
							mines.</dd>

					<img src="images/typical-example4.png">
					<dl>

				<h2 id="tricky">Tricky Examples with Expert Comments</h2>

				<div class="example-image even">
					<img src="images/tricky-example1.png" />
					<dl>
						<dt>Damage rating 0</dt>
						<dd>The brown blotches are the leaf blotch fungus, not the
							leaf-mining moth, because they have an irregular shape and a
							yellow edge.</dd>
					</dl>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</div>

				<div class="example-image odd">
					<img src="images/tricky-example2.png" />
					<dl>
						<dt>Damage rating 0</dt>
						<dd>The brown blotches are leaf damage but are not the leaf
							miner (they are too narrow) and they are not the leaf blotch
							fungus (they are not edged with yellow).</dd>
					</dl>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</div>

				<div class="example-image even">
					<img src="images/tricky-example3.png" />
					<dl>
						<dt>Damage rating 1</dt>
						<dd>A couple of fresh leaf mines (on the bottom left of the
							largest leaflet), but larger patches of the leaf blotch fungus
							(irregular brown patches with a yellow edge).</dd>
					</dl>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</div>

				<div class="example-image odd">
					<img src="images/tricky-example4.png" />
					<dl>
						<dt>Damage rating 1</dt>
						<dd>The leaf-miner has produced three large mines on the
							middle of the leaf (plus two small ones at the leaf tip). All
							these mines are old, which is why they are brown. The browning at
							the edge of the leaf is due either to damage to sap-carrying
							vessels in the tree or the leaf blotch fungus.</dd>
					</dl>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</div>

				<div class="example-image even">
					<img src="images/tricky-example5.png" />
					<dl>
						<dt>Damage rating 1</dt>
						<dd>A few fresh mines. These are pale green with a dirty
							brown mark. The moth caterpillars will still be growing inside
							these mines. None of the chestnut brown markings on the edge of
							the leaf are the miner â€“ they are the leaf blotch (notice the
							irregular edge ringed with yellow).</dd>

					<div class="clear"></div>
				</div>

				<div class="example-image odd">
					<img src="images/tricky-example6.png" />
					<dl>
						<dt>Damage rating 1</dt>
						<dd>A few old leaf mines (brown and within the main leaf
							veins), plus what appears to be some other damage (brown with an
							irregular edge and crosses the leaf veins, no yellow edge, so not
							the leaf blotch fungus).</dd>
					</dl>
					<div class="clear"></div>

				<div class="example-image even">
					<img src="images/tricky-example7.png" />
					<dl>
						<dt>Damage rating 4</dt>
						<dd>Clearly more leaf mines than green leaf. There are
							several generations of the leaf mines: old, brown mines (probably
							over 1 month since the adult moth emerged) and pale
							yellowish-green mines with a dirty splodge, which are fresh
							mines.</dd>

				<div class="example-image odd">

						<dt>Damage rating 4</dt>
						<dd>The whole leaf cannot be seen, but the pattern of the
							blotches (where they can be seen) and the lack of any yellowing
							means this is clearly the leaf miner. This is typical of the
							damage to severely affected trees by mid-summer.</dd>
